# nrf52-production-programming
A guide to programming nRF52 series devices in production, along with test cases to verify implementation. For detailed information on the programming process, see white-paper.md.

## [nRF52 Product Specification](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.nrf52/dita/nrf52/chips/nrf52832_ps.html?cp=1_3_0)
*  CPU, Memory, NVMC, BPROT, UICR, DIF are important sections to read.
*  Power & Clock are less important but should be skimmed.

## Test cases
*  Provided tests in this repository will help verify that your programming algorithms cover important edge cases (not complete test coverage by any means).

## [Reference Hardware Design Files](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/download_resource/50980/3/35868157)
*  May provide some guidance for pin connections etc...
